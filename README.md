# NHLDataAnalysis
This is an individual school project I did from a Data analysis course that looks at NHL statistics from 1967-2016.
It was written using python3 in a Jupyter notebook. Also uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scipy libraries.
If you have jupyter notebook you can view it by opening the Project.ipynb file in the notebook.
If you do not have Jupyter notebook you can view the entire project including the code by going to the wikiPage and clicking the link.
